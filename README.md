# VoxVerba

Local-first audio transcription for Apple Silicon Macs.

Drop in a recording. VoxVerba analyses it with deterministic signal processing,
transcribes it with an on-device speech model, reassembles one continuous
transcript, and optionally uses a local language model to produce clean and
polished versions — without changing what the speaker actually said.

**The original audio is never modified. Nothing leaves the Mac.**

---

## Status: Phase 0 — scaffold

This repository currently contains the module structure, the shared data model,
and the API surface for every stage of the pipeline. Most implementations are
deliberately absent and throw `VoxVerbaError.notImplemented`, naming the phase
that fills them in — nothing here is a placeholder pretending to work.

What is real and tested today:

- `MediaTime` / `TimeRange` / `SampleRange` — exact integer-nanosecond timing
- `SilenceMap` — bidirectional original ↔ processed timeline mapping
- `JobState` / `ChunkState` — the pipeline state machines and their legal transitions
- `Transcript` / `TranscriptSegment` / `Word` — the structured transcript model
- The project package layout, including the guarantee that cleanup cannot reach
  the original audio

84 tests across 22 suites.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or later, Apple Silicon
- Xcode 26 / Swift 6.3
- No network connection, at build time or at run time

## Build

```
swift build
swift test
```

Open `Package.swift` directly in Xcode for a full IDE session. There is no
`.xcodeproj` yet — the SwiftUI app target arrives in Phase 7, when there is an
app to put in it.

```
swift run voxverba-cli help
```

## Architecture

The full technical architecture — technology comparisons, the silence-detection
cascade, the anti-hallucination validation design, memory strategy, and the
phased roadmap — is in [`Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The load-bearing idea, in one paragraph: everything upstream of the speech model
is reproducible. Given the same audio and the same parameters, the decoder, the
silence detector, and the chunk planner produce byte-identical output every time.
That property is what makes resume correct, makes tests meaningful, and makes it
possible to state confidently that no model influenced the audio segmentation.

Dependencies point one way only, and SPM enforces it: a module cannot import a
target it does not declare.

## Privacy

VoxVerba ships without the `com.apple.security.network.client` entitlement, so
the sandbox prevents it from opening a socket even if a dependency tried. CI
additionally fails the build if any source file references a networking API.

There is no telemetry, no analytics, and no transmitting crash reporter.
